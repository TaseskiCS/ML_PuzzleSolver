```sh
h1 : heuristic1()
h2 : heuristic2()
h3 : heuristic3()
```
In this project, I implement the ```A* algorithm``` with heuristics h1, h2, h3 to solve the well known brain teaser ```8 puzzle```, as well as ```15 puzzle```, given any scenario generated by ``generate_puzzles``, 
* Records each steps taken from the START_STATE, to the GOAL_STATE
* Logs performance of the algorithm, based on input size.


## Usage

Run ``main.py`` and select which puzzle to solve through an argument => {8 or 15}:

```sh
python main.py 8   # Runs the 8-puzzle solver
python main.py 15  # Runs the 15-puzzle solver
